# WordPress-Shell-Upload
Authenticated shell upload

1. Authenticates as an Admin user using legitimate credentials that a user would input into the script.
2. Finds currently in use theme automatically.
3. Edits the 404.php page associated with the theme to be a simple web shell

Changing the host, username, and password variable is necessary. You will more than likely need to change the datas variable as well as those may change from each WordPress installation.

Obviously each installation of WordPress can and will be different so this script may not include those intricacies.

I do not condone the use of the script for malicious or illegal activity.
